####The hovering minefield detector

This project focuses on the designing and creation of a minefield mapping drone which can detect and plot the points at which minefields are present and can make the information remotely accessible to the soldiers through a device (yet to be finalized). Sensors will be used to detect its surroundings to help it collect and plot out the required data. 
On extension of the project, it can be additionally equipped with mechanism to deactivate the minefields.

###The Setup

**_Hardware_**

*IR sensor* - A radar can help in detection of the mines.

The drone detects, notes and maps out the positions of the underground mines

*Detonator instrument* -This can be an arm, or a form of external mechanical extension that can dig and cut unwanted wires to deactivate mines depending on the type of mines, depth, type of detonation and deactivation.
 
[*Note: Solve the energy problem, weâ€™ll need enough energy to power multiple motors that can get the drone to hover and detect and map the entire field.
We also need to work on maintaining range and field.]
